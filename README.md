# Username Moderation System [UMS]

## Welcome to the UMS! 

### Description:
The Kick.com Username Moderation Tool is a powerful user script designed to enhance chat moderation capabilities on the Kick.com platform. This script enables streamers and moderators to automatically ban users whose usernames contain specific sequences deemed undesirable or inappropriate. By leveraging customizable bannable sequences, this tool empowers moderators to maintain a safe and welcoming environment within the chat.

### Installation
To use this script, you'll need to have a user script manager installed on your browser. We recommend using Tampermonkey for Chrome or Firefox, or Greasemonkey for Firefox.

Once you have a user script manager installed, simply copy the contents of the UMS.js file into a new user script, or use the "Install from URL" option in your user script manager and paste the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipseymourhoffman/UMS/main/UMS.js

### Key Features:

Automatically identifies and bans users based on specified username sequences.
Customizable configuration allows users to define their own bannable sequences.
Seamlessly integrates with Kick.com chat interface for efficient moderation.

### How to Use:

Install the Username Moderation Tool user script in your browser.

Customize the list of bannable sequences within the script configuration to align with your moderation policies.

To activate moderation for your specific Kick.com channel, update the @match directive in the script metadata to include your username.

Upon activation, the script will automatically monitor chat activity and promptly ban users whose usernames match the specified sequences.
